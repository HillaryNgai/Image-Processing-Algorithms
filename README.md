# Image-Processing-Algorithms
• Coded a fast algorithm for multi-level image thresholding in MATLAB that decreases runtime when compared to built-in image segmentation methods. 
• Programmed an algorithm in MATLAB that converts a grayscale image into a binary image without using built-in computer vision libraries.
